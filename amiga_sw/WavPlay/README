Experimental 16-bit WAV player for Minimig.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Alastair M. Robinson


WavPlay can be run from the shell or from workbench.
There is no user-interface - to play a file either
type
> wavplay path:to/file.wav
on the shell, or set wavplay as the Default Tool in a Wave file's
icon, and then double-click the Wav file, or click one on a Wav
file's icon, hold shift and double-click on WavPlay.

WavPlay will detect and terminate an already-running instance, so
you can stop playback by running WavPlay with no arguments.

Only one sample format is currently supported, namely 44.1Khz 16-bit
stereo Little-endian.  Don't attempt to play any other type of Wav file
- your ears will thank you!
